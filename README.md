# QuatricMorph

Vite + React starter for QuatricMorph with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.

- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`

This scaffolding includes a minimalist landing page (src/App.jsx) that uses /src/assets/logo.png. Replace the placeholder logo at that path with your full-resolution QuatricMorph logo.
